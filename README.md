# LeetCode Monthly Challenge

## Introduction

[LeetCode Monthly Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/) - a part of the [Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/) section

This repo was started as a practice for TypeScript because I just came across TypeScript with React in work, but I have never had the experience to set up a TypeScript project on my own.

Besides, I can practice my coding skills while getting used to know more about TypeScript in general. So, why not.

_I may write some React components to control/show/run some stuff in this repo later_

_If I'd do that, I'd probably going to try out different libraries, such as [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/index.html)_

No guarantees that I will do it => I'm doing this in a real casual style anyway :)

## Content

- Source code + unit tests
- Third-party libraries used:

  - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  - [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)
  - [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)

  Not a lot, but you do still need to make sure to run **`npm install`** first
